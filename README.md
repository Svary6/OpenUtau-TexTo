# OpenUtau-TexTo
A modified version of OpenUtau (https://github.com/stakira/OpenUtau), specifically made to accommodate the Speech-To-Text-To-Teto program made by Acrylic (https://www.youtube.com/@hi-im-acrylic). It allows support for opening and playing .ustx files without having to have the program in focus or in your vision at all. Meant to be combined with the "Complete TexTo" mod of STTT.

The script for playing .ustx is fully automated. All you need is to open the .bat file included in "Complete TexTo", and following that, select the directory in which the file with OpenUtau.exe is. After selecting your directory, the Complete TexTo script will remember this path for the future. If you wish to enter it manually or change it, paste the directory into openutau_path.txt as the only text in the file.

For complete instructions, visit the Complete TexTo github page. 

This OpenUtau version has a Kasane Teto voicebank included, manually tuned to sound a little better, which i've not completely succeeded in. OpenUtau-TexTo is meant to be used ONLY with Kasane Teto and ONLY for the purpose of using it as a way to use Complete TexTo. For any other use, it may or may not work, but it is specifically tailored for speech to text to speech.

Upon launch, select New Project -> Select Singer -> Classic -> Bunch of Japanese characters

Then, click on the field right bellow that, and go English -> EN X-SAMPA 

The voice will NOT work otherwise.

This selection should be done automatically upon running Complete TexTo, but if not, you can do it manually and Complete Texto will do its thing as long as OpenUtau is open. (Even if OpenUtau is closed, the script should open it by itself but who knows)

After you download and use Complete TexTo, your work should be done for you, including playing the playback. If it all works fine, your next job is to install the program VB Cable.

After you do that, go into OpenUtau -> Tools -> Preferences -> Playback Device -> Choose VB Cable

There might be one or two inputs, just test both.

When you switch the playback device, you won't hear Kasane Teto anymore, that's because her voice is going into your microphone instead of your headphones. Now, you can go on a website or a game that allows you to test out your microphone, set it to VB Cable Output there, and test out the Complete TexTo script. If you see soundwaves moving even though you can't hear anything, it's working.

You should be notified to this also by the pesky microphone icon in the top left corner while the Complete TexTo script is active.

This is the first and possibly last version of this program, but if you need any help, watch the before mentioned Acrylic video or message me on discord: svary6

Enjoy your Tetoing. :)
