# OpenUtau-TexTo
A modified version of OpenUtau, specifically made to accommodate the Speech-To-Text-To-Teto program made by Acrylic (https://www.youtube.com/@hi-im-acrylic). It allows support for opening and playing .ustx files without having to have the program in focus or in your vision at all. Meant to be combined with the "Complete TexTo" mod of STTT.
